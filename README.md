Urban Square is a WordPress theme based on a [BlankSlate](https://wordpress.org/themes/blankslate/) core. With this theme, your template will no longer have to look like anyone else’s. You can change the header image, add a custom logo, change the image and colors behind the background, and colors behind the header/footer/sidebar, menus and widgets.

Urban Square is high definition ready, providing [retina.js](https://github.com/strues/retinajs) on option for inline images and an image upload for @2x backgrounds. The Header Image section in the Customizer has additions that let you choose two display modes for header images: **Responsive**– where images stretch with the browser window and **Repeating**– for simple repeating textures/patterns.

Additionally, you can choose between three font themes.
